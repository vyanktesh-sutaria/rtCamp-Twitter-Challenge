<h3>Part 1 :</h3> 

First the user visit the application and there he/she has to log in to their twitter account using their twitter account credentials.The application will ask the user to authorize the application as they log in to in order to give the application access to the user's tweets and follower data.Once logged in, the  most recent 10 tweets of the user will be shown in a slider.

<h3> Part 2 : </h3> 

Below the slider, the user will be displayed a list of 10 random followers along with their profile picture, actual name and screen name as well. A searchbox is displayed above the slide rwith auto-complete functionality which makes the followers show up as soon as the user starts typing in the search box.When user will select a follower from the auto-complete search box suggestion list, 10 recent tweets of that particular user will be displayed in the same slider we discussed in Part - 1 of our application.

Note : Due to the Twitter API limitation we can only download 3200 tweets at a time.

<h3> Part 3 : </h3>

There is a download button with a dropdown list which features a list of different formats(JSON,CSV,XML,Excel,Google Spreadsheet) through which the user can download the tweets as per his/her choice.

NOTE : For downloading the tweet in Google Spreadsheet format the user has to compulsorily log in to their Google Account, which further on will ask the user to allow the application to access their Google drive
